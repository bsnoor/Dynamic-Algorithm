# Dynamic-Algorithm



Dynamic algorithms are a type of algorithm that uses dynamic programming to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid re-computing them. This approach can lead to more efficient algorithms, as it allows for the reuse of previously computed solutions and can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

Dynamic algorithms are particularly useful for solving problems that involve optimization, such as finding the shortest path in a graph or the maximum value in a sequence. They are also commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing.
